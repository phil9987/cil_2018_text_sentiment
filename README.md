# Project for Computational Intelligence Lab at ETH Zurich, Spring 2018

The goal of this project is to build a sentiment classifier that
predicts whether a tweet text used to include a positive smiley `:)`
or a negative smiley `:(`, based on the remaining text.

## Preparing Data

Have a look at the data directory and download the necessary
files. Detailed instructions can be found under `data/README.md`. Once
the data has been downloaded, have a look at the `utils/`
directory. The README in this folder instructs you on how to
pre-process the data.
  
## Baseline I: Random Forest Classifier

## Baseline II: Recurrent Neural Network with LSTM

## Our Model

Recurrent neural network with additions and tweaks to make it perform
better.
